## 📌 About This Repository  
This repository contains all my array-based programming solutions. I regularly solve different array problems to:

- Build a strong logical foundation
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Develop programming confidence
- Master core data structures and algorithms

This repository is language-agnostic — I focus on array-related concepts and can implement solutions in multiple programming languages.
